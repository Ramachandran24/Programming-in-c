5. write a C program that implements a queue using an array, and performs insertion (enqueue) and display operations.

Aim:
To write a C program that implements a queue using an array, and performs insertion (enqueue) and display operations.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.

2. Declare a character array (queue), front, rear, and size.

3. Initialize front = -1, rear = -1.

4. To enqueue (insert):

a. Check if the queue is full: rear == size - 1

b. If the queue is empty (front == -1), set both front and rear to 0.

c. Else, increment rear and insert the element.

5. To display:

a. If front == -1, print "no elements to display".

b. Else, print all elements from front to rear.

6. Provide test cases to show enqueue and display functionality.

7. End the program.
