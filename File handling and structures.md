5. Write a C program to create a file named "Hospital.txt" and display messages on successful creation, opening, and closing of the file.

Aim:
To write a C program to create a file named "Hospital.txt" and display messages on successful creation, opening, and closing of the file.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.

2. Declare a FILE pointer.

3. Use the fopen() function with mode "w" to create or open the file for writing.

4. Check if the file was successfully opened (i.e., pointer is not NULL).

5. If successful:

6. Print “File Created Successfully”.

7. Print “File Opened”.

8. Use fclose() to close the file.

9. Print “File Closed”.

10. If not successful, print an error message.

11. End the program.
