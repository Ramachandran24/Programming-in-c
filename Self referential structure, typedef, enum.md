1. Write a C program demonstrating a self-referential structure where an employee has a pointer to their manager.

Aim:
To write a C program demonstrating a self-referential structure where an employee has a pointer to their manager.

Algorithm:
1. Define a structure Employee with: Name ID

2. A pointer to another Employee (their manager)

3. Create two employees: a manager and a subordinate.

4. Set the subordinate's manager pointer to point to the manager structure.

5. Print both employee and manager details.

6. End the program.

PROGRAM:
// Type your code here

OUTPUT:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here

RESULT:
Thus,the output is verifies successfully.


2. Write a C program that demonstrates the use of enum (enumeration) type to define and use named integer constants.

Aim:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of enum (enumeration) type to define and use named integer constants.

Algorithm:
1. Define an enumeration using the enum keyword.

2. Declare a variable of the enum type.

3. Assign a value from the enum list to the variable.

4. Use a switch or if condition to print the matching value.

5. End the program.

PROGRAM:
// Type your code here

OUTPUT:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here

RESULT:
Thus,the output is verifies successfully.

3. Write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

Aim:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

Algorithm:
1. Use the typedef keyword to define a new name (alias) for a data type or structure.

2. Declare variables using the new alias.

3. Assign values and display the output.

4. End the program.


PROGRAM:
// Type your code here

OUTPUT:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here

RESULT:
Thus,the output is verifies successfully.
