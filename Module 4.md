5. Write a C program to perform basic left and right shift operations on a given integer and display the result.

Aim:
To write a C program to perform basic left and right shift operations on a given integer and display the result.

Algorithm:

1. Start

2. Declare an integer variable a.

3. Read an integer from the user.

4. Perform left shift operation using a << 2 (shifts bits two positions to the left).

5. Perform right shift operation using a >> 2 (shifts bits two positions to the right).

6. Print the results of both operations.

7. End
