1. C Program to convert a given decimal value to binary using function without arguments with return type.

AIM:
To write a program to convert a given decimal value to binary using function without arguments with return type.

ALGORITHM:
1. Start.
2Define a function named calculate_age .
3.	Return the calculated age.
4.	Read the value using scanf.
5.	Ask the user to input their birth year and current year.
6.	Print out the calculated age. 7.End.


PROGRAM:

// Type your code here

Output:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here
 
 
RESULT:
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
 
2. C program to check whether the given number is prime or not.

AIM:
To write a program to check whether the given number is prime or not.

ALGORITHM:
1.	Start
2.	Declare the variable i.
3.	Read the value given using scanf.
4.	Check whether the given number is prime or not using if-else statement condition.
5.	If true,print ("%d is a prime number.",i).
6.	If false, print ("%d is not a prime number.",i).
7.	End.

PROGRAM:

// Type your code here

Output:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here
 
 
RESULT:
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
 

3. C program to read the elements and print only the odd numbers in the n x n matrix.

AIM:
To write a program to read the elements and print only the odd numbers in the n x n matrix.

ALGORITHM:
1.	Start.
2.	Define a variables i,j,n,a.
3.	Write program to find n x n matrix.
4.	Read the value using scanf.
5.	Ask the user to make an input
6.	Print out the answer.
7.	End.

PROGRAM:

// Type your code here

Output:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here
 
 
RESULT:
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
 
4. C program to delete first element in an array. 

AIM:
To write a program to delete first element in an array.

ALGORITHM:
1.	Start.
2.	Define a variables i,j,a.
3.	Read the value using scanf.
4.	Ask the user to make an input
5.	Print out the answer
6.	End.

PROGRAM:

// Type your code here

Output:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here
 
 
RESULT:
Thus, the program is verified successfully.


5. Write a C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.

Aim:

To write a C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.


Algorithm:

1. Start

2. Declare an integer array and a character array of the same size.

3. Read the number of elements (n) from the user.

4. Loop n times to read the integer elements into the array.

5. Traverse the array:

a. If the element is even, store 'E' in the character array.

b.If the element is odd, store the element as it is (converted to character or just print the number).

6. Print the modified array where even numbers are replaced with 'E'.

7. End

PROGRAM:

// Type your code here

Output:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here
 
 
RESULT:
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
