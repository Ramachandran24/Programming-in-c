5. Write a C function to delete a node from a Doubly Linked List, either at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.

Aim:
To write a C function to delete a node from a Doubly Linked List, either at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.

2. Define a structure Node with:

3. An integer data.

4. A pointer to the previous node (prev).

5. A pointer to the next node (next).

6. To delete a node with a specific value:

7. Traverse the list until the node with matching data is found.

8. Update the prev and next pointers of neighboring nodes:

9a. If deleting head, move head to next node.

b. If deleting tail, set previous nodeâ€™s next to NULL.

c. If deleting middle, bypass the node by linking prev and next.

10. Free the memory of the deleted node.

11. Display a message if the element is not found.

12. End the program.

PROGRAM:
// Type your code here

OUTPUT:

// Paste your Output Screenshot here

RESULT:
Thus,the output is verifies successfully.
