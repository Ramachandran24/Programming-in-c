5. Write a C program to check whether a given character is a vowel or consonant using pointer

Aim:
To write a C program to check whether a given character is a vowel or consonant using pointer.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.

2. Declare a character variable and a pointer to character.

3. Accept a character input from the user.

4. Assign the address of the character variable to the pointer.

5. Use an if statement to check whether the character pointed by the pointer is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u or their uppercase equivalents).

6. If it is a vowel, print “Vowel”.

7. Else, check if it's an alphabet character; if so, print “Consonant”.

8. If the input is not a letter, print an appropriate message.

9. End the program.
