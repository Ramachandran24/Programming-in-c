5. Write a C program to compare two strings using the strcmp() function.

Aim:
To write a C program to compare two strings using the strcmp() function.

Algorithm:

1. Start

2. Declare two character arrays (strings) to store user input.

3. Prompt the user to enter two strings.

4. Use the built-in strcmp() function from the string.h library to compare the strings.

5. If strcmp() returns:

a.  o: The strings are equal.

b. Less than 0: First string is less than the second string.

c. Greater than 0: First string is greater than the second string.

6. Display the result.

7. End
