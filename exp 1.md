4. write a C program to read the age of a person and determine whether he is eligible for marriage (eligible if age ≥ 21).

Aim:
To write a C program to read the age of a person and determine whether he is eligible for marriage (eligible if age ≥ 21).

Algorithm:

1. Start

2. Declare a variable to store age (e.g., int age).

3. Prompt the user to enter their age.

4. Read the input and store it in the age variable.

5. If age >= 21, print "He is eligible for marriage".

6. Otherwise, print "He is not eligible for marriage".

7. End
